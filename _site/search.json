    "text": "This is very much not a sponsored post (though if they wanted to sponsor me I would absolutely accept) but after “discovering” quarto, I’ve decided to move my personal blog and my more in-depth project writeups to this quarto based site!\nI first learned about quarto this past quarter, thanks to my wonderful Professor Vivian Lew who I had the pleasure of having this past winter quarter for the first part of my statistical consulting capstone at UCLA. As someone who loves scientific computing, it has completely revolutionized a bunch of the things I did before. I love how markdown based it is, as I switched to markdown for all my note-taking prior to my final year here at UCLA. It makes formatting a breeze for someone aesthetically challenged like me. It also saves me from having to learn more front-end development (React is cool but I really don’t want to learn more than I need to).\nThat, plus the ability to integrate code directly with R and Python (my two favorite languages) made me ditch the manual .jsx files I was using to write up on my professional website and switch to quarto for every need it could possibly satisfy. That and I thought it might be a good idea to keep my personal little parts of the website and my corner of the Internet in its own place.\nAll of this leads me to a happy declaration that this is my official first quarto blog post and hopefully the first of many more! I hope to make some nice walkthroughs of my favorite personal projects and just some more personal posts to put into the abyss.\nNote: If you’re wondering, the posts below this in chronological order are converted from my previous blog setup."

    "text": "Who knows what they want to major in anyway?\nTo be honest I never really anticipated finding myself in this position. For pretty much as long as I could remember, I was convinced I was going to become a scientist. Whether it be biology or chemistry, I knew the classes I enjoyed the most every single year were those science classes. Mathematics was the bane of my existence, a topic I had neither the talent nor the patience for. I would never choose a career with that as the focus.\nEven when it came to applying to college, I applied to colleges based on googling “best colleges for science” and then just choosing some that sounded like they had cool programs. Going into college my aspirations had changed a bit, but I was still of the belief I would become a scientist. I entered UCLA in 2021 as a Biology major, which was what I applied for in most of the applications I sent out. The first few quarters were fun, I mostly took the chemistry courses and math courses required for lower division life science requirements. To my own surprise, I really enjoyed the math for life scientists (shoutout Professor Jukka) but I really enjoyed the chemistry classes too. It wasn’t until my spring quarter that I was finally able to take what I came here for, a biology class.\nIt started off fine it wasn’t exactly some kind of dramatic realization I came to immediately. As the quarter progressed though I found myself falling asleep during lecture and just not being able to invest myself into the content. At first, I thought it was a general problem with my concentration and work. At the same time though, I was taking organic chemistry and seemed to have no issues staying alert in that class. As the year ended, I wasn’t sure if I truly wanted to be a biology student for the rest of my 4 years. That being said, I had already signed up for my classes for the next fall.\nAt first I refused to think of even leaving the life sciences department. If I left, what was the point of my entire first year? Did I just waste money and time? I spent my time reading about every offered major on the UCLA course websites, trying to decide what I really wanted to learn about. When I truly thought about it, I realized that maybe my enjoyment for the life sciences math wasn’t some random exception. After all, I had really enjoyed my time taking AP Statistics back in high school. Despite that, I feared not being proficient enough for the math and thought things might just be easier if I stayed doing what I was doing. After all, I couldn’t even enroll in new classes until much later as new student orientation had already begun.\nI talked to many people before ultimately making my decision, but I entered my new path Fall 2022 as I began taking the math prerequisite courses for becoming a stats major. Though I did have to make some adjustments initially, it didn’t take long for me to realize I had made the right decision for myself. Looking back at my own interests in hindsight, it almost seemed obvious the entire time. When I was little, I loved memorizing sports statistics, especially the stats of my favorite athletes. When I first learned programming and computer science in high school, the first independent projects I created were all sports statistics related. I had just attributed this to my love for sports, but perhaps that interest was always there and I just had a mental block.\nSince changing my major, I can confidently say I have no regrets at all. I’ve truly enjoyed every single class I’ve taken since that day. Every day I spend in class or working on something only furthers my belief that I’m in this for life. Getting paid to do the most fun stuff of all time? That career sounds way too good to be true, but I really cannot think of a better way to live. That being said, I don’t regret the path I was on before switching. Sometimes I think about what I could’ve done with that extra time, but there are many experiences I don’t get in that timeline. As for this timeline, I’m just going to put my head down and keep trying to learn about a field that is always changing. Living in the age of information is truly a blessing, and I fully intend to take advantage of it.\nShoutout to the entire UCLA Statistics department for providing such a fun and comprehensive education. Professor Christou you are my GOAT."

    "text": "My own little place to post into the void\nI can’t tell you how many times I’ve looked up cool people on Google and they’ve had their own little nice website with fancy logos and nice-looking pages and all that. To be frank, that was probably the main reason I wanted my own website. I too wanted a shiny place that was all about me.\nDespite having this in mind for quite a while, I never actually tried to make one of my own until recently. For the longest time, I had assumed even getting a domain name would mean shelling out money for eternity just to have a site I could send to people. Who knew how many people would actually look at it, let alone view the other content?\nUltimately, what pushed me to really try it out was wanting to just have one place where I could show all my friends and family the little things I did in my free time that I thought were cool. At the end of the day, even if no one else viewed this website organically, I would be happy just having a place with a nice little write-up for everything I’ve tinkered with. The sudden motivation for this website really came in late September 2024 on a random weekend. That’s what led me to create my first website using Netlify. I didn’t exactly know how to do web development with code directly, so I just used their visual editor and a website template and called it a day. One night later, I had a fully functional website with posts I could show everyone. However, the longer I had the site, the more discontent I became with it. I almost felt like I cheated to get a website that wasn’t even cohesive and didn’t represent what I wanted my website to say about me. With a busy school quarter, I pushed it down the line with the intention of eventually creating a site I was proud of.\nI hadn’t used JavaScript and CSS in an extremely long time. Not since one of my first projects ever that I created in high school—a basketball player comparison tool that scraped data from the web—had I attempted to make a whole website of my own. Even then, it was barely something that could be called a website. It was a bare-bones page with the project tool as the main focus, and the website was basically just a place to have it. I wanted to use Next.js because I’d joined a club in the fall that created really nice-looking visuals and animations with that as their main language. I had no idea what it was, but with the help of YouTube videos and the internet, I was able to cobble up a functional website I can say I am proud of.\nIs my website amazing and impressive? I don’t know, but I’m glad I have my own little place to put things that I want to see. The experience of creating the site was a blast, and I hope to mess around with a lot more in the future so I can add even more to this website. If anyone stumbles across this in the future and would like to give me feedback on my website (or even my code), I would greatly appreciate it. This is something I hope to continue working on for the rest of my life, and I hope 2025 brings more things for me to be proud of. Here’s to the future.\nThank you for reading my rambling justification for the existence of this website. If you think I could make this better (I definitely can), I would love to hear new ideas.\nYou can check out the code I used to create it here!"
