This is very much not a sponsored post (though if they wanted to sponsor me I would absolutely accept) but after "discovering" quarto, I've decided to move my personal blog and my more in-depth project writeups to this quarto based site! 

I first learned about quarto this past quarter, thanks to my wonderful Professor Vivian Lew who I had the pleasure of having this past winter quarter for the first part of my statistical consulting capstone at UCLA. As someone who loves scientific computing, it has completely revolutionized a bunch of the things I did before. I love how markdown based it is, as I switched to markdown for all my note-taking prior to my final year here at UCLA. It makes formatting a breeze for someone aesthetically challenged like me. It also saves me from having to learn more front-end development (React is cool but I really don't want to learn more than I need to).

That, plus the ability to integrate code directly with R and Python (my two favorite languages) made me ditch the manual .jsx files I was using to write up on my professional website and switch to quarto for every need it could possibly satisfy. That and I thought it might be a good idea to keep my personal little parts of the website and my corner of the Internet in its own place. 

All of this leads me to a happy declaration that this is my official first quarto blog post and hopefully the first of many more! I hope to make some nice walkthroughs of my favorite personal projects and just some more personal posts to put into the abyss.

Note: If you're wondering, the posts below this in chronological order are converted from my previous blog setup.
